I have been building websites, scripts and programs to solve problems that arise in my daily life since as early as 2017.

I am a huge [Typescript](/public/typescript-meme.png) enthusiast that subscribes to building safe, performant and testable code
which fully leverages the language server to generate auto-completions and code suggestions.

I am currently on a quest to expand my horizons and try some new technologies. I recently built some stuff with
[Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) as well as [Astro](https://astro.build/) and so far I can say they are quite promising as
lightweight alternatives to React and Next.js for building production ready applications.

I have also been learning Japanese as a hobby that I started in 2020 and my friends say that I have gotten pretty good.

I am also a New York City local and have lived here for most of my life. If you want to know some secret spots, send me a message and let's hang out some time üëç.
