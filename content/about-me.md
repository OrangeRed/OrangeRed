I have been building websites, scripts and programs to solve problems that arise in my
daily life since 2017.

I am a huge [Typescript](/public/typescript-meme.png) enthusiast that subscribes to
building safe, performant and testable code that can fully leverage the language
server for auto-completions and code suggestions to create a smooth developer
experience.

I am currently on a quest to expand my horizons and try out some new technologies in
search of a way to build robust applications without compromising on developer
experience. I recently built some projects with [Sveltekit](https://kit.svelte.dev/)
and so far I can say that I am quite impressed with what the framework has to offer.

For the past three years I have also been learning Japanese as a hobby and I am always
looking for people to talk to, <br>
もし興味があれば日本語で話しましょう！

I am also a NYC local, having lived here for most of my life, so if you are interested
in exploring the city, send me a message and let's hang out some time 👍.
